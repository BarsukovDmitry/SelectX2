SelectX2
========

SelectX2 is a jQuery based replacement for select boxes. It replaces standard HTML select box with 2 select boxes. The first one shows selected options. The second one shows options available for selection.

SelectX2 can be useful when users need to select ranges of options from not very long list: from one option to another using SHIFT and CTRL buttons. Also it is useful for old IE browsers (IE < 8).
